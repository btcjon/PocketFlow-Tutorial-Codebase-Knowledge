Merging: upstream/main into main

## Strategy
1. Keep our MoveToDocs functionality
2. Keep our MCP server implementation
3. Keep our LLM provider customization
4. Accept upstream improvements where they don't conflict with our features

## Files with conflicts:
- README.md - Will merge both changes
- flow.py - Keep our MoveToDocs import and workflow
- main.py - Keep our llm-provider argument
- nodes.py - Keep our MoveToDocs class and improvements
- requirements.txt - Merge all dependencies
- utils/call_llm.py - Merge improvements
- utils/crawl_github_files.py - Accept upstream improvements
- utils/crawl_local_files.py - Accept upstream improvements
- docs/PocketFlow/index.md - Accept upstream version
- docs/index.md - Accept upstream version
