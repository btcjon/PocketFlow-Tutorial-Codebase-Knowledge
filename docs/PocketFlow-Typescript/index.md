# Tutorial: PocketFlow-Typescript

PocketFlow-Typescript is a framework for building *data processing workflows*.
It allows you to define individual task units called **Nodes**, which perform specific operations.
These Nodes are organized and executed in sequence by a **Flow**.
Data and context are passed between Nodes within a Flow using **SharedData**.
The framework provides specialized types:
- **BatchNode** and **ParallelBatchNode** are Nodes designed to process collections of items, either *sequentially* or in *parallel*.
- **BatchFlow** and **ParallelBatchFlow** are Flows that execute an entire sub-flow multiple times for different sets of parameters, either *sequentially* or in *parallel*.
