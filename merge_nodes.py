"""Script to help merge nodes.py conflicts"""

# Strategy for nodes.py:
# 1. Keep upstream's improved file handling (UTF-8 BOM, etc)
# 2. Keep our max_chars_per_file parameter for smart truncation
# 3. Keep our llm_provider customization
# 4. Keep our MoveToDocs class at the end
# 5. Merge any other improvements from upstream

Merge strategy for nodes.py:

1. In get_content_for_indices():
   - Keep our max_chars_per_file parameter and smart truncation logic
   
2. In IdentifyAbstractions class:
   - Keep our llm_provider logic
   - Keep our smart truncation in create_llm_context
   
3. In AnalyzeRelationships class:
   - Keep our llm_provider logic
   - Keep our max_chars_per_file in get_content_for_indices call
   
4. In WriteChapters class:
   - Keep our max_chars_per_file in get_content_for_indices call
   
5. At the end of file:
   - Keep our entire MoveToDocs class

The main conflicts are around:
- The get_content_for_indices function signature
- LLM provider environment variable setting
- File truncation logic
