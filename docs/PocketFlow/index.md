# Tutorial: PocketFlow

PocketFlow is a framework for building **multi-step workflows**. It uses self-contained *Nodes* to perform individual tasks, which are connected together into sequences or networks by a *Flow*. Data is passed and shared between Nodes using a central *Shared Store*. The path the Flow takes is determined by *Actions* returned by Nodes. PocketFlow provides specific ways to handle collections of items efficiently through *Batch Processing*, manage tasks that wait via *Asynchronous Processing* using async/await, and speed up batch tasks by running items concurrently with *Parallel Processing*.
