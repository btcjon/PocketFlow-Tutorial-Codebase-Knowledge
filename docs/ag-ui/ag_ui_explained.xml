# Chapter 1: AG-UI Events

Welcome to the AG-UI tutorial! We're excited to help you understand how to build amazing applications where AI agents and user interfaces can communicate seamlessly. In this first chapter, we'll dive into the most fundamental concept: **AG-UI Events**.

## The Communication Challenge: AI and UI Talking to Each Other

Imagine you're building a web application with a helpful AI chatbot. A user types a question, like "What's the weather like today?" and hits send.

*   How does your web page (the **frontend** or **UI**) know that the AI (the **backend agent**) has received the question and started working on an answer?
*   How does the UI display the AI's answer as it's being typed out, word by word, for a nice real-time effect?
*   What if the AI needs to ask the UI to perform an action, like displaying a map?
*   How does the UI know when the AI is completely finished, or if an error occurred?

This is where AG-UI Events come in. They solve this communication challenge!

## What are AG-UI Events? The Digital Messengers

**AG-UI Events are the fundamental "messages" or "signals" that an AI agent backend sends to a frontend application.**

Think of them like status updates or commands in a real-time conversation. They are the language that both the AI agent and the UI agree to use so they can understand each other.

Let's use an analogy: Imagine you're on a phone call with a friend who is looking up information for you.
*   Your friend might say, "Okay, I'm starting to look it up now." (This is like an event telling the UI the AI has started).
*   Then, they might say, "I found the first part, it's..." (This is like an event sending a piece of the answer).
*   And finally, "Alright, that's all the info I have!" (This is like an event signaling the AI is done).

AG-UI Events work similarly. An agent might send an event to say "I'm starting to type a message," then "here's a piece of the message," and finally "I'm done with this message."

There are specific types of events for:
*   **Text messages**: For chat-like interactions.
*   **Tool calls**: When the agent wants the frontend to perform an action (e.g., display a calendar, fetch user location).
*   **State changes**: To update the UI about the agent's internal status (e.g., "thinking", "fetching data").
*   **Overall run lifecycle**: To signal the beginning of an interaction, its successful completion, or if an error happened.

This standardized set of events ensures that different AI agents (even if built with different technologies) and different UIs can understand each other. It forms the core language of AG-UI.

## A Closer Look at an Event's Journey: AI Saying "Hello"

Let's go back to our chatbot. The user has just sent a message. Now, the AI agent wants to respond with "Hello there!". Here's how it might use AG-UI Events to communicate this to your application's frontend:

1.  **`RUN_STARTED`**: The AI agent first sends an event like this:
    *   **Meaning**: "I've started processing the user's request and will begin my work now."
    *   **UI Action**: The UI might show a small loading spinner or a message like "Agent is thinking..."

2.  **`TEXT_MESSAGE_START`**: Next, an event indicating a new message from the assistant is beginning:
    *   **Meaning**: "I'm about to send a text message. Get ready to display it!"
    *   **UI Action**: The UI prepares a new message bubble for the assistant's response.

3.  **`TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`** (with "Hello "):
    *   **Meaning**: "Here's the first part of my message: 'Hello '"
    *   **UI Action**: The UI displays "Hello " in the assistant's message bubble.

4.  **`TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`** (with "there!"):
    *   **Meaning**: "Here's the next part of my message: 'there!'"
    *   **UI Action**: The UI appends "there!" to the existing "Hello ", so it now shows "Hello there!". This creates that cool, real-time typing effect.

5.  **`TEXT_MESSAGE_END`**:
    *   **Meaning**: "I'm done with this particular text message."
    *   **UI Action**: The UI can finalize the message display (e.g., remove the typing indicator if it had one).

6.  **`RUN_FINISHED`**: Finally, if the agent has completed all its tasks for this interaction:
    *   **Meaning**: "I've finished everything for this turn."
    *   **UI Action**: The UI can remove the loading spinner and indicate that the agent is ready for the next input.

This sequence allows your UI to be very responsive and keep the user informed about what the AI is doing.

## Key Types of AG-UI Events

As you saw in the example, AG-UI defines several types of events. Here are the main categories:

*   **Text Message Events**:
    *   `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`: Signals the beginning of a new text message from the agent.
    *   `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`: Delivers a piece (a "delta") of the text content.
    *   `TEXT_MESSAGE_END`: Signals the end of the current text message.
    *   `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK`: A more compact way to send parts of a message, sometimes including the start or role.
*   **Tool Call Events**:
    *   `TOOL_CALL_START`: The agent wants the frontend to execute a "tool" (a function or capability the UI provides) and is providing its name.
    *   `TOOL_CALL_ARGS`: Delivers a piece of the arguments (input) for the tool.
    *   `TOOL_CALL_END`: Signals the end of the arguments for that tool call.
    *   `TOOL_CALL_CHUNK`: Similar to `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK`, but for tool calls.
*   **State Management Events**:
    *   `STATE_SNAPSHOT`: Provides a complete picture of some shared data or state.
    *   `STATE_DELTA`: Provides only the changes to the shared state (more efficient for updates).
    *   `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT`: Provides a complete list of all messages in the conversation so far.
*   **Run Lifecycle Events**:
    *   `RUN_STARTED`: The agent has started a new execution run.
    *   `RUN_FINISHED`: The agent has successfully finished the run.
    *   `RUN_ERROR`: An error occurred during the run.
*   **Step Lifecycle Events** (for more granular tracking within a run):
    *   `STEP_STARTED`: A specific step within the agent's process has started.
    *   `STEP_FINISHED`: That specific step has finished.
*   **Other Events**:
    *   `RAW`: For sending events from an underlying system without direct AG-UI mapping.
    *   `CUSTOM`: For application-specific events you might want to define.

Don't worry if this list seems long! You'll typically only use a few of these at a time, depending on what your AI and UI need to do. We'll explore some of these, particularly messages and state, in more detail in [Chapter 3: Message and State Types](03_message_and_state_types_.md).

## What Does an Event Look Like? (A Peek Under the Hood)

AG-UI events are structured data, often represented in a format like JSON. Here’s a simplified example of what a `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` event might look like:

```json
{
  "type": "TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT",
  "message_id": "msg_assistant_123",
  "delta": "Hello "
}
```

Let's break this down:

*   `"type": "TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT"`: This is crucial! It tells the receiving application exactly what kind of event this is. The UI will use this to decide how to handle the event.
*   `"message_id": "msg_assistant_123"`: This helps group parts of the same message. All `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` events for the "Hello there!" message would share this ID.
*   `"delta": "Hello "`: This is the actual piece of content for this specific event. "Delta" means "change" or "increment."

Every AG-UI event will have a `type` field. The other fields will vary depending on the event type.

## How Events Flow: From Agent to UI

Let's visualize the journey of these events from the AI agent (backend) to your user interface (frontend).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant FrontendApp as Frontend Application
    participant AgentBackend as AI Agent Backend
    participant AGUIProtocol as AG-UI Event Structure

    User->>FrontendApp: Types "Hi" and sends
    FrontendApp->>AgentBackend: Sends user's message
    Note over AgentBackend: Agent decides to reply "Hello!"
    AgentBackend->>AGUIProtocol: 1. Creates RUN_STARTED event
    AgentBackend->>FrontendApp: Emits RUN_STARTED event
    FrontendApp->>FrontendApp: Updates UI (e.g., "Agent thinking...")
    AgentBackend->>AGUIProtocol: 2. Creates TEXT_MESSAGE_START event
    AgentBackend->>FrontendApp: Emits TEXT_MESSAGE_START event
    FrontendApp->>FrontendApp: Prepares for new AI message
    AgentBackend->>AGUIProtocol: 3. Creates TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT (delta: "Hello")
    AgentBackend->>FrontendApp: Emits TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT event
    FrontendApp->>FrontendApp: Shows "Hello"
    AgentBackend->>AGUIProtocol: 4. Creates TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT (delta: "!")
    AgentBackend->>FrontendApp: Emits TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT event
    FrontendApp->>FrontendApp: Appends "!", shows "Hello!"
    AgentBackend->>AGUIProtocol: 5. Creates TEXT_MESSAGE_END event
    AgentBackend->>FrontendApp: Emits TEXT_MESSAGE_END event
    AgentBackend->>AGUIProtocol: 6. Creates RUN_FINISHED event
    AgentBackend->>FrontendApp: Emits RUN_FINISHED event
    FrontendApp->>FrontendApp: Finalizes UI state
```

Here's what's happening:

1.  The **AI Agent Backend** (which we'll learn more about in [Chapter 2: Agent (Abstract Representation)](02_agent__abstract_representation__.md)) decides it needs to communicate something.
2.  It constructs an **AG-UI Event** object, filling in the `type` and other necessary data (like `delta` for content).
3.  This event is then sent over a communication channel (like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events). The details of how events are packaged and sent are covered in [Chapter 5: Event Encoding and Transport](05_event_encoding_and_transport_.md).
4.  Your **Frontend Application** receives this event.
5.  The frontend then looks at the event's `type` and uses its content to update the display or take other actions. How the client-side handles this stream of events is the topic of [Chapter 4: Event Stream Processing Pipeline (Client-side)](04_event_stream_processing_pipeline__client_side__.md).

## A Glimpse into the Code: Defining Events

To ensure consistency, AG-UI provides definitions for these events, for example, in Python and TypeScript. You don't usually need to write these definitions yourself, but it's good to see how they're structured.

First, there's a list of all possible event types. Here's a small part of how it looks in Python (from `ag_ui.core.events`):

```python
# From ag_ui.core.events
from enum import Enum

class EventType(str, Enum):
    TEXT_MESSAGE_START = "TEXT_MESSAGE_START"
    TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT = "TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT"
    TEXT_MESSAGE_END = "TEXT_MESSAGE_END"
    # ... many other event types
```
This `EventType` enum simply defines the allowed string values for the `type` field in an event.

All events share some common properties. A `BaseEvent` might be defined like this (simplified Python version):

```python
# Simplified from ag_ui.core.events
class BaseEvent:
    type: EventType         # What kind of event is this?
    timestamp: Optional[int] # When did it happen? (Optional)
    # ... other common fields
```
This means every AG-UI event will at least have a `type` and potentially a `timestamp`.

Then, each specific event type builds on this. For example, `TextMessageContentEvent`:

```python
# Simplified from ag_ui.core.events
# (Assuming Literal and Optional are imported)
class TextMessageContentEvent(BaseEvent):
    type: Literal[EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT] # Confirms it's this specific type
    message_id: str      # ID of the message this content belongs to
    delta: str           # The actual piece of text
```
Here, `type` is specifically `EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, and it adds fields like `message_id` and `delta` that are relevant only to this kind of event. Similar structures exist in the TypeScript SDK (`typescript-sdk/packages/core/src/events.ts`).

These definitions ensure that when an agent sends an event, and a UI receives it, they both agree on its structure and meaning.

## Conclusion: Events are Key!

You've now learned the foundational concept of AG-UI: **Events**. These are the messages that flow between your AI agent and your UI, enabling them to have rich, real-time interactions. They tell the UI when the agent starts working, what it's saying, if it needs the UI to do something, and when it's finished.

By standardizing these events, AG-UI makes it much easier to connect various AI backends to various frontends.

In the next chapter, we'll take a closer look at the sender of these events: the [Chapter 2: Agent (Abstract Representation)](02_agent__abstract_representation__.md).

# Chapter 2: Agent (Abstract Representation)

In [Chapter 1: AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md), we learned about the "digital messengers" – AG-UI Events – that enable communication between an AI backend and a frontend application. Now, let's meet the sender of these messages: the **Agent**.

## What's an Agent? The Blueprint for Your AI

Imagine you want to build different types of AI helpers for your application:
*   A simple chatbot that greets users.
*   A more complex AI that can access a database to answer questions.
*   An AI that uses external tools, like a weather API.

How do we make sure all these different AIs can talk to your frontend using the AG-UI Events we just learned about? We need a common structure, a standard way for these AIs to operate.

This is where the **Agent (Abstract Representation)** comes in. Think of it as a **blueprint or a recipe** for creating AI agents within the AG-UI framework, especially when you're using the TypeScript SDK.

This blueprint defines:
1.  **The main task**: A core method called `run`. This is like the main cooking process in a recipe. It's where the agent does its thinking and generates the AG-UI Events.
2.  **The necessary ingredients**: What information the `run` method needs to do its job. This includes things like a `threadId` (to keep track of the conversation), the `messages` exchanged so far, and any `state` (memory) the agent has.
3.  **How to manage its operation**: Special methods for handling things like errors (`onError`) or cleaning up when the agent is done (`onFinalize`). These are like instructions for what to do if your cooking goes wrong or how to clean the kitchen afterwards.

Any specific AI agent you build, like an `HttpAgent` that communicates with a server over HTTP, or a simple `CustomAgent` for demonstration purposes, must follow this blueprint. By doing so, they automatically know how to "speak" the AG-UI protocol by emitting the standard [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md), allowing them to connect and communicate correctly with your frontend.

## The `AbstractAgent`: Our Blueprint in Code

In the AG-UI TypeScript SDK, this blueprint is primarily defined by a class called `AbstractAgent`. When you create your own agent, you'll typically *extend* this `AbstractAgent` class.

```typescript
// Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/agent/agent.ts
export abstract class AbstractAgent {
  // ... some properties like threadId, messages, state ...

  // This is the method YOU MUST implement in your own agent
  protected abstract run(input: RunAgentInput): Observable<BaseEvent>;

  // Lifecycle methods (you can override these if needed)
  protected onError(error: Error) { /* ... default error handling ... */ }
  protected onFinalize() { /* ... default finalization ... */ }

  // ... other helpful methods ...
}
```
Let's break this down:
*   `abstract class AbstractAgent`: The keyword `abstract` means you can't create an `AbstractAgent` directly. It's a template meant to be built upon.
*   `protected abstract run(...)`: This is the most important part.
    *   `protected`: Means it's mainly for internal use within the agent and its subclasses.
    *   `abstract`: Means that any class that extends `AbstractAgent` *must* provide its own version of the `run` method. This is where your agent's unique logic will go.
    *   `input: RunAgentInput`: These are the "ingredients" for your agent. We'll see what's inside `RunAgentInput` shortly.
    *   `Observable<BaseEvent>`: The `run` method is expected to return an "Observable" stream of `BaseEvent` objects. An Observable is like a conveyor belt that delivers events one by one over time. `BaseEvent` is the basic type for all [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) we saw in Chapter 1.
*   `onError(error: Error)` and `onFinalize()`: These are "lifecycle" methods. `AbstractAgent` provides default behavior, but you can customize them in your agent if you need to do something special when an error occurs or when the agent finishes its entire operation.

## Building a Simple Agent: "Hello World" CustomAgent

Let's make this concrete. Imagine we want to build a very simple agent that, when run, just says "Hello world!". We'll call it `CustomAgent`.

Here's how `CustomAgent` would look, following the `AbstractAgent` blueprint (you've seen this in `dojo/src/custom-agent.ts`):

```typescript
// From: dojo/src/custom-agent.ts
import {
  AbstractAgent,
  RunAgentInput,
  EventType,
  BaseEvent,
} from "@ag-ui/client";
import { Observable } from "rxjs"; // For creating the event stream

export class CustomAgent extends AbstractAgent {
  protected run(input: RunAgentInput): Observable<BaseEvent> {
    const messageId = "msg-" + Date.now(); // A unique ID for our message

    // We return an Observable: a stream of events
    return new Observable<BaseEvent>((observer) => {
      // 1. Tell the UI we've started
      observer.next({
        type: EventType.RUN_STARTED,
        runId: input.runId, // Use the runId from the input
      } as BaseEvent); // We cast to BaseEvent for simplicity here

      // 2. Start a new text message
      observer.next({ type: EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_START, messageId } as BaseEvent);

      // 3. Send the content of the message
      observer.next({
        type: EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT, messageId, delta: "Hello world!"
      } as BaseEvent);

      // 4. End the text message
      observer.next({ type: EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_END, messageId } as BaseEvent);

      // 5. Tell the UI we've finished
      observer.next({ type: EventType.RUN_FINISHED, runId: input.runId } as BaseEvent);

      // 6. Signal that there are no more events in this stream
      observer.complete();
    });
  }
}
```

Let's dissect this `CustomAgent`:
1.  `export class CustomAgent extends AbstractAgent`: Our `CustomAgent` *extends* (inherits from) `AbstractAgent`. This means it promises to follow the blueprint.
2.  `protected run(input: RunAgentInput): Observable<BaseEvent>`: We implement the required `run` method.
    *   `input: RunAgentInput`: This object contains useful information. For now, we're just using `input.runId` which is a unique identifier for this specific execution of the agent.
3.  `new Observable<BaseEvent>((observer) => { ... })`: This creates the "conveyor belt" for our events. The `observer` object has methods like `next()` (to send an event) and `complete()` (to say the stream is finished).
4.  `observer.next({...})`: Each `observer.next()` call sends an AG-UI Event. Notice the `type` field, like `EventType.RUN_STARTED`, `EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, etc. These are the exact event types we discussed in [Chapter 1: AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md)!
5.  The sequence of events (`RUN_STARTED`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`, etc.) is exactly what the UI expects for an agent that says "Hello world!".

This `CustomAgent` is a perfect example of an agent implementation. It adheres to the `AbstractAgent` contract by providing a `run` method that emits a stream of standard AG-UI Events.

### What's in `RunAgentInput`? The Agent's "Ingredients"

The `run` method receives an `input` parameter of type `RunAgentInput`. This object bundles all the necessary information for the agent to do its job. Here are some key "ingredients" it contains:

```typescript
// A simplified view of RunAgentInput
interface RunAgentInput {
  threadId: string;        // ID for the entire conversation
  runId: string;           // ID for this specific agent execution
  messages: Message[];     // History of messages in the conversation
  state: State;            // Current state/memory of the agent
  tools?: Tool[];          // Optional tools the agent can use
  // ... and a few other properties
}
```
*   `threadId`: An identifier for the ongoing conversation or session.
*   `runId`: A unique identifier for this particular run of the agent.
*   `messages`: An array containing the history of messages. This is crucial for context. We'll explore `Message` types in detail in [Chapter 3: Message and State Types](03_message_and_state_types_.md).
*   `state`: An object representing the agent's current internal state or memory. Also covered in [Chapter 3: Message and State Types](03_message_and_state_types_.md).
*   `tools`: A list of "tools" (functions or capabilities) the agent can request the frontend to execute.

When you call your agent, the `AbstractAgent` class helps prepare this `RunAgentInput` object for you.

## How an Agent is Run: Under the Hood

When you want your agent to start working (e.g., after a user sends a message), you typically call a method like `agent.runAgent()`. What happens then?

Let's trace the flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FrontendApp as Frontend Application
    participant YourAgent as YourAgent (e.g., CustomAgent)
    participant AbstractAgentBase as AbstractAgent (Base Class)
    participant EventStream as AG-UI Event Stream

    Note over FrontendApp, YourAgent: You create an instance: const myAgent = new CustomAgent();
    FrontendApp->>YourAgent: Calls myAgent.runAgent(parameters)
    YourAgent->>AbstractAgentBase: (Inherited) runAgent() method is called
    AbstractAgentBase->>AbstractAgentBase: Prepares RunAgentInput (e.g., adds runId, current messages, state)
    AbstractAgentBase->>YourAgent: Calls YOUR overridden run(input) method
    YourAgent->>EventStream: Your run() method starts producing AG-UI Events (Observable stream)
    EventStream-->>AbstractAgentBase: Events flow back
    AbstractAgentBase->>AbstractAgentBase: Processes events (e.g., updates internal messages/state based on events)
    AbstractAgentBase-->>FrontendApp: (Effectively) Processed events are available for the UI
```

1.  **Frontend Initiates**: Your frontend code decides it's time for the agent to act and calls `yourAgentInstance.runAgent()`.
2.  **`AbstractAgent` Takes Over**: The `runAgent()` method (defined in `AbstractAgent` and inherited by `YourAgent`) kicks in.
3.  **Input Preparation**: `AbstractAgent` first prepares the `RunAgentInput` object. It gathers the current `threadId`, `messages`, `state`, generates a new `runId`, and packages any parameters you passed.
    ```typescript
    // Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/agent/agent.ts
    // Inside AbstractAgent:
    protected prepareRunAgentInput(parameters?: RunAgentParameters): RunAgentInput {
      return {
        threadId: this.threadId,
        runId: parameters?.runId || uuidv4(), // Generate a runId if not provided
        messages: structuredClone_(this.messages), // Current messages
        state: structuredClone_(this.state),       // Current state
        // ... other inputs like tools, context
      };
    }
    ```
4.  **Calling Your `run` Method**: The `AbstractAgent` then calls the `run` method that *you* defined in `YourAgent` (like our `CustomAgent`), passing the prepared `RunAgentInput`.
    ```typescript
    // Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/agent/agent.ts
    // Inside AbstractAgent's runAgent logic:
    // const input = this.prepareRunAgentInput(parameters);
    // const eventStream$ = this.run(input); // Calls YOUR agent's run method!
    // ...
    ```
5.  **Your Agent Generates Events**: Your `run` method executes and starts producing a stream (an `Observable`) of AG-UI Events.
6.  **Event Processing Pipeline**: The `AbstractAgent` doesn't just pass these events straight through. It has a pipeline to:
    *   `transformChunks`: Handle special "chunk" events for efficiency.
    *   `verifyEvents`: Check if the events are valid AG-UI events (useful for debugging).
    *   `applyEvents`: Update the agent's internal `messages` and `state` based on the events received. This keeps the agent's own understanding of the conversation and state in sync.
    *   Handle errors (`onError`) and cleanup (`onFinalize`).

This structure ensures that all agents behave consistently and that their internal state (like the message list) is correctly updated as they emit events.

## Different Chefs, Same Recipe: Other Agent Implementations

The beauty of the `AbstractAgent` blueprint is that many different kinds of agents can follow it.

### `HttpAgent`: Talking to a Remote Server

Another common type of agent is one that communicates with an AI model hosted on a remote server. The `HttpAgent` (from `typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/agent/http.ts`) is an example of this.

Its `run` method looks different from our `CustomAgent`:

```typescript
// Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/agent/http.ts
export class HttpAgent extends AbstractAgent {
  // ... constructor and config for URL, headers ...

  protected run(input: RunAgentInput): Observable<BaseEvent> {
    // 1. Make an HTTP request to the configured URL with the input
    const httpEvents = runHttpRequest(this.url, this.requestInit(input));

    // 2. Transform the server's response (which might be raw events)
    //    into standard AG-UI BaseEvents
    return transformHttpEventStream(httpEvents);
  }

  // Helper to prepare the HTTP request details
  protected requestInit(input: RunAgentInput): RequestInit { /* ... */ }
}
```
Here, the `run` method doesn't create events directly. Instead:
1.  It makes an HTTP POST request to a server URL (configured when the `HttpAgent` is created). The `RunAgentInput` is typically sent as the body of this request.
2.  It expects the server to respond with a stream of events.
3.  The `transformHttpEventStream` function then converts these server events into the standard `BaseEvent` objects that the AG-UI frontend understands.

Even though its internal logic is very different (network communication vs. direct event creation), `HttpAgent` still fulfills the `AbstractAgent` contract by providing a `run` method that returns an `Observable<BaseEvent>`. This allows the frontend to interact with an `HttpAgent` in the exact same way it would interact with a `CustomAgent`.

## Conclusion: The Agent as Your AI's Core

You've now seen that the **Agent (Abstract Representation)**, embodied by the `AbstractAgent` class in the TypeScript SDK, provides a crucial blueprint. It ensures that any AI backend you create or use can:
*   Receive necessary context (like message history and state).
*   Execute its core logic within a `run` method.
*   Communicate its actions and results back to the frontend using the standard [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md).

This abstraction is key to building modular and interoperable AI-powered applications with AG-UI. It allows you to swap out different agent implementations (simple custom ones, complex HTTP-based ones) without needing to change how your frontend expects to interact with them.

In the next chapter, we'll delve deeper into the "ingredients" that agents often work with: [Chapter 3: Message and State Types](03_message_and_state_types_.md).

# Chapter 3: Message and State Types

In [Chapter 2: Agent (Abstract Representation)](02_agent__abstract_representation__.md), we learned about the `AbstractAgent` blueprint and how an agent's `run` method is the heart of its operation, receiving inputs and producing a stream of [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md).

But what about the *actual data* that makes up a conversation? When a user types "Hello," or the AI responds "How can I help?", how is that structured? And what if the agent and UI need to share some background information that isn't a direct chat message, like the status of a long-running task?

This is where **Message and State Types** come in. They define the structure of this core data, going beyond the event wrappers themselves.

## The Need for Structure: More Than Just Event Signals

Imagine you're building a chat application.
*   You need to distinguish between what the **user** says and what the **AI assistant** says.
*   Sometimes, the AI might need to perform an action using a "tool," and you'll want to record the result of that tool use.
*   There might be "system" level instructions or context given to the AI that aren't shown to the user directly but are still part of the conversation's history.

Simply sending raw text through events isn't enough. We need a way to categorize these different kinds of information. Similarly, if an AI is working on a multi-step recipe for the user, both the AI and the UI might need to know "we are on step 3 of 5." This shared understanding is what `State` provides.

## Message Types: The Different "Speech Bubbles"

Think of `Message` types as the different kinds of speech bubbles you see in a chat app. Each message has a specific **role**, a unique **ID** (so we can track it), and **content**.

AG-UI defines several common message roles:

*   👤 **User Message**: Represents what the human user types or inputs.
    *   *Example*: "What's the weather like in London?"
*   🤖 **Assistant Message**: Represents what the AI agent says in response. This can be plain text or can include requests for the UI to execute "tools" (like fetching data or displaying a map).
    *   *Example*: "The weather in London is partly cloudy with a chance of rain."
    *   *Example with tool call*: "Okay, I need to use the `get_weather` tool for London. [tool_call_details]"
*   ⚙️ **System Message**: Often used to provide initial instructions, context, or guidelines to the AI. These are usually not directly displayed to the end-user but help shape the AI's behavior.
    *   *Example*: "You are a helpful assistant. Be polite and concise."
*   🛠️ **Tool Message** (or Tool Result Message): Contains the output or result from a "tool" that the Assistant requested to be run.
    *   *Example*: (After `get_weather` tool runs) "Temperature: 15°C, Condition: Partly Cloudy."

Each of these message types will have a common structure, typically including:
*   `id`: A unique identifier for this specific message.
*   `role`: A string like `"user"`, `"assistant"`, `"system"`, or `"tool"`. This tells us who "said" it.
*   `content`: The actual text of the message.
*   Other fields specific to the role (e.g., `tool_calls` for an `AssistantMessage` or `tool_call_id` for a `ToolMessage`).

When an agent runs (as discussed in [Chapter 2: Agent (Abstract Representation)](02_agent__abstract_representation__.md)), it receives the history of these messages in the `RunAgentInput.messages` array. This history provides the context for the agent to generate its next response.

## State: The Shared Notepad

Beyond direct conversation messages, the agent and the UI might need to share other kinds of information. This is what `State` is for.

**`State` represents any arbitrary shared information between the agent and the UI that isn't a direct message.**

Think of `State` as a shared digital notepad or a whiteboard that both the agent and the user interface can see and (potentially) modify. It's a flexible place to store data that helps coordinate their activities or maintain context.

Here are some examples of what `State` could hold:
*   The current status of a multi-step task: `{"current_step": "analyzing_data", "total_steps": 5}`
*   Information about a document being collaboratively edited: `{"document_id": "doc123", "last_edited_by": "user"}`
*   User preferences that affect the agent's behavior: `{"preferred_language": "fr", "detail_level": "high"}`
*   A simple counter: `{"api_calls_made": 10}`

The `State` is also passed to the agent in the `RunAgentInput.state` object. The agent can then read this state to inform its decisions, and it can also request changes to the state, which are then communicated back to the UI.

## How These Types are Defined: The Blueprints for Data

To ensure the agent and the UI understand each other, these `Message` and `State` types are formally defined. In the AG-UI SDKs (Python and TypeScript), these definitions often use libraries like Pydantic (for Python) or Zod (for TypeScript) to describe the expected shape of the data.

Let's look at a simplified example of how message types might be defined in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Simplified structure for any message
interface BaseMessage {
  id: string;        // Unique ID for the message
  role: string;      // "user", "assistant", "system", "tool"
  content?: string;  // The text content (optional for some roles initially)
}

// A UserMessage must have the role "user" and content
interface UserMessage extends BaseMessage {
  role: "user";
  content: string;
}

// An AssistantMessage must have the role "assistant"
// Its content might be built up piece by piece
interface AssistantMessage extends BaseMessage {
  role: "assistant";
  // It might also have 'toolCalls' if it's asking the UI to do something
}
```
*   `BaseMessage`: Shows the common fields like `id` and `role`.
*   `UserMessage`: Extends `BaseMessage` and specifies that `role` must be `"user"` and `content` is required.
*   `AssistantMessage`: Similarly specifies `role` as `"assistant"`.

These definitions (found in `python-sdk/ag_ui/core/types.py` and `typescript-sdk/packages/core/src/types.ts`) act as a contract. When the agent sends data structured as an `AssistantMessage`, the UI knows what fields to expect and how to interpret them.

For `State`, it's often defined as `Any` or `z.any()` (in Zod), meaning it can be any valid JSON structure. This gives you maximum flexibility.

```typescript
// In TypeScript, State can often be any type
type State = any;
```

## Messages and State in Action: The Flow of Information

Now, let's see how these types are used during an interaction. Remember from [Chapter 2: Agent (Abstract Representation)](02_agent__abstract_representation__.md) that the agent's `run` method receives `RunAgentInput`, which contains the current `messages` history and the current `state`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientUI as Client UI
    participant AgentRuntime as AG-UI Client/Agent Host
    participant YourAgentLogic as Your Agent's `run` method

    Note over ClientUI, AgentRuntime: User types "Book a flight" and sends.
    ClientUI->>AgentRuntime: Sends user input.
    AgentRuntime->>YourAgentLogic: Calls `run({ messages: [UserMessage("Book a flight")], state: { ...current_state... } })`
    Note over YourAgentLogic: Agent decides to ask for destination.
    YourAgentLogic->>AgentRuntime: Emits `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` (role: "assistant", new_message_id)
    AgentRuntime->>ClientUI: Forwards `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`
    YourAgentLogic->>AgentRuntime: Emits `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` (delta: "Sure, where to?")
    AgentRuntime->>ClientUI: Forwards `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` (UI shows "Sure, where to?")
    YourAgentLogic->>AgentRuntime: Emits `TEXT_MESSAGE_END`
    AgentRuntime->>ClientUI: Forwards `TEXT_MESSAGE_END`
    Note over YourAgentLogic: Agent updates shared state.
    YourAgentLogic->>AgentRuntime: Emits `STATE_DELTA` (payload: `{ "booking_status": "awaiting_destination" }`)
    AgentRuntime->>ClientUI: Forwards `STATE_DELTA` (UI can update status display)
```

Here's what's happening:

1.  **Input to Agent**:
    *   The `AgentRuntime` (part of the AG-UI client library) prepares the `RunAgentInput`. This includes the list of past `Message` objects (like the `UserMessage` "Book a flight") and the current `State` object.
    *   It then calls your agent's `run` method with this input.

2.  **Agent Processing & Sending New Messages**:
    *   Your agent's logic processes the input messages and state.
    *   When it wants to send a new `AssistantMessage` (e.g., "Sure, where to?"), it doesn't just send a complete `AssistantMessage` object in one go. Instead, it uses a sequence of [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) we learned about in Chapter 1:
        *   `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`: Signals the beginning of a new message, its `id`, and its `role` (e.g., `"assistant"`).
        *   `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`: Sends a piece (a "delta") of the message's text. This can be sent multiple times for a streaming effect.
        *   `TEXT_MESSAGE_END`: Signals that this particular message is complete.
    *   The Client UI receives these events and reconstructs the assistant's message to display it.

3.  **Agent Updating State**:
    *   If the agent wants to change the shared `State` (e.g., to update `booking_status`), it emits specific state events:
        *   `STATE_DELTA`: Sends only the *changes* to the state. This is efficient if only a small part of the state updated.
        *   `STATE_SNAPSHOT`: Sends a complete new version of the entire state object.
    *   The Client UI receives these state events and updates its local copy of the state. This might trigger UI changes, like updating a status indicator.

Sometimes, an agent might also send a `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` event, which contains a full list of all `Message` objects in the conversation so far. This is useful for syncing the UI if it joins a conversation late or needs to refresh its entire view.

## Conclusion: Well-Defined Data for Clear Communication

You've now learned about `Message` and `State` types – the structured data that forms the core of the interaction between your AI agent and the user interface.
*   **`Message` types** (User, Assistant, System, Tool) clearly define the roles and content of conversational exchanges, much like different speech bubbles.
*   **`State`** provides a flexible "shared notepad" for any other information that needs to be synchronized between the agent and the UI.

By having well-defined structures for this data, AG-UI ensures that both the agent and the UI have a common understanding, leading to more robust and predictable applications. These types are the "what" that is being communicated, while the [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) are the "how" they are transmitted.

In the next chapter, we'll explore how the client-side (your frontend application) takes the stream of AG-UI events (carrying information about these messages and state changes) and processes them to update the user interface: [Chapter 4: Event Stream Processing Pipeline (Client-side)](04_event_stream_processing_pipeline__client_side__.md).

# Chapter 4: Event Stream Processing Pipeline (Client-side)

Welcome to Chapter 4! In [Chapter 3: Message and State Types](03_message_and_state_types_.md), we explored the structure of the data that flows between the AI agent and your UI, like `Message` objects (who said what) and `State` objects (shared context). Now, we're going to see how your frontend application (the client-side) actually handles the incoming stream of [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) that carry this information.

## What's the Big Deal with Processing Events?

Imagine your AI agent is like a chef in a busy kitchen, sending out dishes (data) as they're ready. The events are like the waiters bringing these dishes to the customer (your UI). But it's not always as simple as just placing the dish on the table.

*   Sometimes, a dish (a message) comes in several parts (e.g., "Hello..." then "...there!"). The waiter needs to assemble it.
*   The waiter needs to make sure the chef isn't sending a dessert before the main course (events in the wrong order).
*   Finally, the customer's table (the UI's internal data) needs to be updated to reflect the new dishes.

This is what the **Event Stream Processing Pipeline (Client-side)** does. It's a sequence of steps your AG-UI client application (usually in TypeScript) performs to make sense of the stream of events coming from the agent. It ensures data is handled correctly and your UI stays perfectly in sync with what the agent is doing.

Think of it as an assembly line for AG-UI events on the frontend.

## The Three Main Stages of the Pipeline

Our event processing pipeline in the AG-UI client has three main stages. Each event that arrives from the agent goes through these stages:

1.  **`transformChunks`**: *Assembling الكامل Messages from Pieces*
    Sometimes, for efficiency, an agent might send parts of a message or tool call in compact "chunk" events (like `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK`). This first stage takes these chunks and converts them into the standard sequence of events (e.g., `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_END`) that are easier to work with.
    *   **Analogy**: An assembly worker who receives a kit of small parts and assembles them into a larger, recognizable component.

2.  **`verifyEvents`**: *Quality Control for Events*
    This stage acts like a protocol inspector. It checks if the agent is sending events in the correct order and format. For example, it ensures a `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` event (part of a message) isn't sent before a `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` event (which signals a new message).
    *   **Analogy**: A quality control inspector on the assembly line who checks if each component is built correctly and in the right sequence before it moves on.

3.  **`applyEvents`**: *Updating the UI's Brain*
    Once an event has been transformed (if needed) and verified, this final stage takes the event and uses it to update the UI's internal knowledge. This means updating the list of [Messages](03_message_and_state_types_.md) (the conversation history) and the shared [State](03_message_and_state_types_.md).
    *   **Analogy**: The final station on the assembly line where the correct, assembled components are used to update the main product (the UI's data and display).

Let's see how this pipeline helps with a simple example. Suppose the agent wants to send "Hi!" and it uses a `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK` event:

*   **Agent sends**: `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK { messageId: "m1", delta: "Hi" }`
    (This is a compact way to send the first part of a new message)

Now, let's see it go through the client-side pipeline:

1.  **`transformChunks` receives the `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK`**:
    *   It sees this is the start of a new message "m1".
    *   It outputs two standard events:
        1.  `TEXT_MESSAGE_START { messageId: "m1", role: "assistant" }`
        2.  `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT { messageId: "m1", delta: "Hi" }`

2.  **`verifyEvents` receives these events one by one**:
    *   Receives `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`: "Okay, a new assistant message is starting. This is valid."
    *   Receives `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`: "Okay, content for message 'm1'. This is valid because 'm1' just started."
    *   If the agent later sent another `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` for a *different* `messageId` before `m1` ended, `verifyEvents` would flag an error!

3.  **`applyEvents` receives the verified events**:
    *   Receives `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`:
        *   It adds a new, empty assistant message object with `id: "m1"` to the UI's internal list of messages.
        *   So, `messages` might now look like: `[{ id: "m1", role: "assistant", content: "" }]`
    *   Receives `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT { delta: "Hi" }`:
        *   It finds the message with `id: "m1"` and appends "Hi" to its content.
        *   `messages` becomes: `[{ id: "m1", role: "assistant", content: "Hi" }]`
    *   The UI can then re-render to show the "Hi!" message.

If the agent then sends `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK { messageId: "m1", delta: "!" }` and then a final chunk indicating the end, the pipeline would ensure "!" is appended and the message is marked as complete.

## Under the Hood: How the Pipeline is Set Up

This pipeline is orchestrated within the `AbstractAgent` class we learned about in [Chapter 2: Agent (Abstract Representation)](02_agent__abstract_representation__.md). When you call `agent.runAgent()`, it sets up this stream processing.

Here's a simplified look at how these stages are chained together using RxJS (a library for handling streams of data) in `typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/agent/agent.ts`:

```typescript
// Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/agent/agent.ts
// Inside AbstractAgent.runAgent():

const pipeline = pipe( // pipe connects operations
  () => this.run(input),         // 0. Agent's run() method produces raw events
  transformChunks(this.debug),   // 1. Transform Chunks
  verifyEvents(this.debug),      // 2. Verify Events
  (source$) => this.apply(input, source$), // 3. Apply Events to update state
  // ... other operations for logging, error handling ...
);

// Then, this pipeline is executed.
```
This `pipe` function is like connecting different sections of our assembly line. Each event flows from one stage to the next.

Let's visualize this flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Agent (emits raw events)
    participant TC as transformChunks
    participant VE as verifyEvents
    participant AE as applyEvents
    participant UIData as UI's Internal Data (Messages & State)

    Agent->>TC: Event (e.g., TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK)
    TC->>TC: Processes chunk
    TC->>VE: Standard Event 1 (e.g., TEXT_MESSAGE_START)
    VE->>VE: Validates Event 1
    VE->>AE: Verified Event 1
    AE->>AE: Processes Event 1
    AE->>UIData: Updates (e.g., new message added)
    TC->>VE: Standard Event 2 (e.g., TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT)
    VE->>VE: Validates Event 2
    VE->>AE: Verified Event 2
    AE->>AE: Processes Event 2
    AE->>UIData: Updates (e.g., message content appended)
```

Now, let's peek into each stage a bit more.

### Stage 1: `transformChunks` - Assembling Components

File: `typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/chunks/transform.ts`

This stage is responsible for converting compact "chunk" events like `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK` or `TOOL_CALL_CHUNK` into a series of standard AG-UI events. For example, a single `TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK` that contains the start of a message and some content will be expanded.

```typescript
// Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/chunks/transform.ts
// Inside transformChunks logic:
// If a TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK event arrives...
if (event.type === EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK) {
  const chunk = event as TextMessageChunkEvent;
  
  // Is this the first chunk for this messageId?
  if (/* it's a new messageId or no message is active */) {
    // Emit TEXT_MESSAGE_START
    outputStream.next({ 
      type: EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_START, 
      messageId: chunk.messageId, 
      role: "assistant" // Chunks are usually from assistant
    });
  }

  // Emit TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT with the chunk's delta
  outputStream.next({ 
    type: EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT, 
    messageId: chunk.messageId, 
    delta: chunk.delta 
  });

  // If chunk also signals end, emit TEXT_MESSAGE_END (not shown for brevity)
}
```
This ensures that the rest of the pipeline (`verifyEvents` and `applyEvents`) can work with a consistent set of more granular events like `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, and `TEXT_MESSAGE_END`.

### Stage 2: `verifyEvents` - The Quality Inspector

File: `typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/verify/verify.ts`

This function acts as a strict bouncer, ensuring events follow the rules of the AG-UI protocol. It maintains some state about the ongoing interaction (e.g., "is a message currently being streamed?").

For example, it checks that a `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` event only arrives when a text message has already been started with `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` and has the correct `messageId`.

```typescript
// Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/verify/verify.ts
// Inside verifyEvents logic:
let activeMessageId: string | undefined; // Tracks current open message

// ...
if (event.type === EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_START) {
  activeMessageId = (event as TextMessageStartEvent).messageId;
} else if (event.type === EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT) {
  if (!activeMessageId) {
    // ERROR! Content without a start.
    return throwError(() => new AGUIError("Content without start!"));
  }
  if ((event as TextMessageContentEvent).messageId !== activeMessageId) {
    // ERROR! Content for the wrong message.
    return throwError(() => new AGUIError("Content ID mismatch!"));
  }
} else if (event.type === EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_END) {
  activeMessageId = undefined; // Message is now closed
}
// ... many more checks for other event types and sequences ...
```
If an event breaks the rules, `verifyEvents` will usually stop the stream and report an error. This is incredibly helpful for debugging agent behavior.

### Stage 3: `applyEvents` - Updating the UI's Knowledge

File: `typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/apply/default.ts`

This is where the validated events finally cause changes to the client's internal representation of the conversation (`messages`) and any shared `state`.

Let's see how it handles `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` and `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`:

```typescript
// Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/apply/default.ts
// messages and state are kept in closure and updated
// let messages = initialMessages;
// let state = initialState;

// ...
if (event.type === EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_START) {
  const startEvent = event as TextMessageStartEvent;
  const newMessage: Message = {
    id: startEvent.messageId,
    role: startEvent.role,
    content: "", // Start with empty content
  };
  messages.push(newMessage); // Add to our list of messages
  return emitUpdate({ messages }); // Signal that messages updated
}

if (event.type === EventType.TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT) {
  const contentEvent = event as TextMessageContentEvent;
  // Find the last message (assuming it's the active one)
  const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];
  if (lastMessage && lastMessage.id === contentEvent.messageId) {
    lastMessage.content += contentEvent.delta; // Append the new text
  }
  return emitUpdate({ messages }); // Signal that messages updated
}
// ... handles other events like STATE_DELTA, TOOL_CALL_START etc. ...
```
When `applyEvents` processes an event that modifies `messages` or `state`, it emits an update. Your UI framework (like React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte) can then listen for these updates and re-render the necessary parts of the screen. For example, if `messages` is updated, your chat log component would refresh to show the new or changed message.

## Why This Pipeline Matters

This client-side processing pipeline is crucial for a few reasons:
*   **Consistency**: It ensures all events are handled in a standardized way.
*   **Resilience**: `verifyEvents` helps protect your UI from malformed or out-of-sequence data from the agent.
*   **Developer Experience**: By separating concerns (`transform`, `verify`, `apply`), it makes the AG-UI client library easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
*   **Flexibility**: It allows agents to send events in more efficient "chunked" formats, while the client takes care of normalizing them.
*   **Synchronization**: It's the mechanism that keeps your UI's view of the world (its `messages` and `state`) in lockstep with the agent's activity.

## Conclusion: Order from Chaos

You've now seen how the AG-UI client takes the potentially complex stream of events from an AI agent and processes it through a well-defined pipeline: `transformChunks` (assemble), `verifyEvents` (inspect), and `applyEvents` (update). This "assembly line" ensures that your UI can reliably interpret the agent's communications and keep the user experience smooth and synchronized.

This pipeline primarily deals with the *content* and *sequence* of events. But how do these events physically travel from the agent (potentially on a server) to your client application (in the browser)? That's the topic of our next chapter: [Chapter 5: Event Encoding and Transport](05_event_encoding_and_transport_.md).

# Chapter 5: Event Encoding and Transport

Welcome to Chapter 5! In [Chapter 4: Event Stream Processing Pipeline (Client-side)](04_event_stream_processing_pipeline__client_side__.md), we saw how your frontend application takes the stream of AG-UI events and processes them to update your UI. But how do these events actually travel from the AI agent (which might be on a server far away) to your user's browser? And how are they "packaged" for this journey?

That's what this chapter is all about: **Event Encoding and Transport**.

## The Journey of an Event: Like Sending a Letter

Imagine your AI agent wants to send an [AG-UI Event](01_ag_ui_events_.md), like `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, to your UI.
*   The event itself is the **content of the letter** (e.g., "Hello there!").
*   Before you can send a letter, you need to put it in an **envelope**. This is **Encoding**. It's about preparing the event data in a format suitable for sending over a network.
*   Then, you need to choose a **shipping method** (like regular mail, express courier). This is **Transport**. It's about the actual mechanism used to send the encoded event.
*   Finally, when the letter arrives, the recipient needs to **open the envelope** to read the content. This is **Decoding** on the receiving end.

AG-UI needs a reliable way to package (encode) events and send them (transport) so they arrive intact and can be understood (decoded) by the client.

## The "Envelope": Encoding Your Events

Encoding means converting the structured AG-UI event object (which might exist in your agent's Python or TypeScript code) into a sequence of bytes or a string that can be sent over a network. AG-UI primarily supports two "envelope" types:

### 1. JSON over Server-Sent Events (SSE): The Readable Postcard

*   **What it is**: Your event data is formatted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is human-readable text. This JSON string is then typically sent using a technology called Server-Sent Events (SSE).
*   **Analogy**: Think of it like writing your message clearly on a postcard. Anyone who intercepts it can read it easily.
*   **Pros**:
    *   **Human-readable**: Great for debugging! You can often see the JSON data directly in your browser's developer tools.
    *   **Simple to implement**: SSE is a straightforward standard for servers to stream data to clients.
*   **Cons**:
    *   **Larger size**: Text-based JSON is usually more verbose than binary formats, meaning it takes up more bandwidth.

A JSON-encoded event sent via SSE might look something like this over the network:
```
data: {"type":"TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT","message_id":"msg123","delta":"Hello"}

data: {"type":"TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT","message_id":"msg123","delta":" world"}

```
Each `data:` line followed by a JSON object is a separate event or part of an event message. The double newline `\n\n` signals the end of an SSE message.

### 2. Protocol Buffers (Protobuf): The Compact, Secure Package

*   **What it is**: Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a binary format developed by Google. It's designed to be very efficient. Your event data is converted into a compact sequence of bytes.
*   **Analogy**: This is like putting your message in a special, small, efficiently packed box. It's not easily readable by just looking at it, but it's very quick to ship and unpack if you have the key (the Protobuf definition).
*   **Pros**:
    *   **Smaller size**: Binary formats are typically much smaller than text, saving bandwidth.
    *   **Faster parsing**: Decoding binary data can be quicker than parsing JSON strings.
    *   **Strongly typed**: Protobuf definitions enforce a schema, which can help prevent errors.
*   **Cons**:
    *   **Not human-readable**: You can't easily inspect the raw data without tools.
    *   **More setup**: Requires defining your event structures in a `.proto` file and generating code.

AG-UI provides these Protobuf definitions for you, so you don't have to create them from scratch.

## The "Shipping Method": Transporting Events

Once an event is encoded (put in an "envelope"), it needs to be transported. The most common transport mechanism for web applications is **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**.

*   **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: This is a specific way of using HTTP that allows a server to continuously send data (stream) to a client once an initial connection is established. It's a perfect fit for JSON-encoded AG-UI events because it's designed for text-based event streams.
*   **HTTP for Protobuf**: Protobuf-encoded events are also sent over HTTP. Often, when streaming binary data like Protobuf, each message is prefixed with its length (e.g., a 4-byte number saying "the next message is X bytes long"). This helps the receiver know when one message ends and the next begins.

## The Senders and Receivers: `EventEncoder` and Parsers

AG-UI provides tools to handle this encoding and decoding:

### `EventEncoder` (Server-Side): Packaging the Events

On the server side (where your AI agent often lives), `EventEncoder` classes are responsible for taking an [AG-UI Event](01_ag_ui_events_.md) object and converting it into the chosen format (JSON for SSE, or Protobuf).

*   In Python (`python-sdk/ag_ui/encoder/encoder.py`), the `EventEncoder` can format events as SSE strings.
    ```python
    # Simplified from ag_ui.encoder.encoder.py
    # event is an AG-UI BaseEvent object
    def _encode_sse(self, event: BaseEvent) -> str:
        # Convert event object to JSON string
        json_data = event.model_dump_json(by_alias=True, exclude_none=True)
        return f"data: {json_data}\n\n" # SSE format
    ```
    This Python code takes an event object, turns it into a JSON string, and then formats it as an SSE `data:` line.

*   In TypeScript (`typescript-sdk/packages/encoder/src/encoder.ts`), the `EventEncoder` can choose between SSE (JSON) or Protobuf based on what the client says it can accept (using HTTP `Accept` headers).
    ```typescript
    // Simplified from typescript-sdk/packages/encoder/src/encoder.ts
    // event is an AG-UI BaseEvent object
    
    // For SSE (JSON)
    encodeSSE(event: BaseEvent): string {
      return `data: ${JSON.stringify(event)}\n\n`;
    }

    // For Protobuf
    encodeProtobuf(event: BaseEvent): Uint8Array {
      const messageBytes = proto.encode(event); // proto.encode is from @ag-ui/proto
      // ... (code to add 4-byte length prefix to messageBytes) ...
      return prefixedBytes; // This is a Uint8Array (binary data)
    }
    ```
    This TypeScript `EventEncoder` has methods for both SSE and Protobuf. The `encodeProtobuf` method uses `proto.encode` (from `@ag-ui/proto`) to serialize the event into binary and then adds a length prefix.

The server uses the `EventEncoder` to prepare events and then writes the output (string for SSE, bytes for Protobuf) to the HTTP response.

### Client-Side Parsers: Unpacking the Events

When the client (your frontend application in the browser) receives this data stream over HTTP, it needs to decode it. AG-UI provides parser functions for this:

*   **`parseSSEStream`**: If you're using JSON over SSE. This function takes the incoming stream of text, splits it into individual SSE messages, extracts the JSON data, and parses it back into JavaScript objects.
    Located in: `typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/transform/sse.ts`

    ```typescript
    // Conceptual flow of parseSSEStream
    // httpResponseStream: a stream of text chunks from the server
    // output: a stream of parsed AG-UI event objects

    // 1. Accumulate text chunks.
    // 2. When a double newline ("\n\n") is found, an SSE message is complete.
    // 3. For each line starting with "data: ", extract the content.
    // 4. Join multi-line data if any.
    // 5. JSON.parse() the resulting string.
    // 6. Emit the parsed event object.
    ```
    This parser diligently processes the text stream to reconstruct the original JSON events.

*   **`parseProtoStream`**: If you're using Protobuf. This function takes the incoming stream of binary data. It reads the 4-byte length prefix to know how many bytes the actual Protobuf message is, then reads those bytes, and then uses `proto.decode` (from `@ag-ui/proto`) to convert them back into AG-UI event objects.
    Located in: `typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/transform/proto.ts`

    ```typescript
    // Conceptual flow of parseProtoStream
    // httpResponseStream: a stream of binary chunks (Uint8Array)
    // output: a stream of parsed AG-UI event objects

    // 1. Accumulate binary chunks in a buffer.
    // 2. If buffer has >= 4 bytes, read the 4-byte length prefix (N).
    // 3. If buffer has >= (4 + N) bytes, extract the N message bytes.
    // 4. Use proto.decode(messageBytes) to parse into an AG-UI event object.
    // 5. Emit the parsed event object.
    // 6. Remove processed bytes from buffer and repeat.
    ```
    This parser carefully handles the binary stream to correctly extract and deserialize each Protobuf message.

These parsers are crucial because they turn the raw network data back into the structured [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) that the [Event Stream Processing Pipeline (Client-side)](04_event_stream_processing_pipeline__client_side__.md) can then work with.

## End-to-End Flow: From Agent to UI

Let's visualize the journey for an event:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AgentBackend as AI Agent Backend
    participant EvtEncoder as EventEncoder
    participant HTTPServer as HTTP Server
    participant Network
    participant HTTPClient as Browser HTTP Client
    participant Parser as Client Parser (SSE/Proto)
    participant Pipeline as Client Event Pipeline

    AgentBackend->>EvtEncoder: Creates AG-UI Event (e.g., TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT)
    EvtEncoder->>EvtEncoder: Encodes event (to JSON/SSE string or Protobuf bytes)
    EvtEncoder->>HTTPServer: Passes encoded data
    HTTPServer->>Network: Sends data over HTTP
    Network->>HTTPClient: Delivers data chunks
    HTTPClient->>Parser: Passes raw data chunks
    Parser->>Parser: Decodes data (JSON.parse or proto.decode)
    Parser->>Pipeline: Emits structured AG-UI Event
    Pipeline->>Pipeline: Processes event (transform, verify, apply)
```
This shows how the event is created, packaged, shipped, received, unpackaged, and finally processed by the client.

## Why Two Methods? Flexibility and Choice

AG-UI supports both JSON/SSE and Protobuf to give you flexibility:
*   **During development and debugging**: JSON over SSE is often easier because you can directly inspect the event data.
*   **For production and performance-critical applications**: Protobuf can offer significant advantages in terms of speed and bandwidth usage.

Typically, the client can tell the server what formats it prefers using the HTTP `Accept` header. For example, it might say "I prefer `application/vnd.ag-ui.event+proto`, but I also accept `text/event-stream` (SSE)". The server can then choose the best common format. The `EventEncoder` in the TypeScript SDK (`typescript-sdk/packages/encoder/src/encoder.ts`) has logic to check this `Accept` header:

```typescript
// From typescript-sdk/packages/encoder/src/encoder.ts
// Simplified check
private isProtobufAccepted(acceptHeader: string): boolean {
  // Checks if AGUI_MEDIA_TYPE for Protobuf is in the acceptHeader
  return acceptHeader.includes(proto.AGUI_MEDIA_TYPE); 
}

getContentType(): string {
  if (this.acceptsProtobuf) { // true if isProtobufAccepted was true
    return proto.AGUI_MEDIA_TYPE; // "application/vnd.ag-ui.event+proto"
  } else {
    return "text/event-stream"; // For JSON/SSE
  }
}
```
The `getContentType` method helps the server set the correct `Content-Type` header in its HTTP response, telling the client what kind of "envelope" it's sending.

## A Deeper Look at the Code Components

Let's briefly revisit the key files involved:

*   **`python-sdk/ag_ui/encoder/encoder.py` (Python `EventEncoder`)**:
    *   Provides `_encode_sse` to format an event as a JSON string within an SSE `data:` line.
    *   `get_content_type` returns `"text/event-stream"` as it primarily focuses on SSE.

*   **`typescript-sdk/packages/encoder/src/encoder.ts` (TypeScript `EventEncoder`)**:
    *   `constructor` can take an `accept` header string.
    *   `isProtobufAccepted` checks if the client supports AG-UI's Protobuf media type.
    *   `getContentType` returns the appropriate media type (`application/vnd.ag-ui.event+proto` or `text/event-stream`) based on client preference.
    *   `encodeSSE` serializes an event to a JSON string for SSE.
    *   `encodeBinary` (which can call `encodeProtobuf`) serializes an event to `Uint8Array` (binary data). `encodeProtobuf` uses `proto.encode` and adds a 4-byte length prefix.

*   **`typescript-sdk/packages/proto/src/proto.ts` (Protobuf Encoding/Decoding Logic)**:
    *   `encode(event: BaseEvent): Uint8Array`: Takes an AG-UI event object and converts it into raw Protobuf binary data (`Uint8Array`). It handles mapping event fields to the Protobuf message structure.
    *   `decode(data: Uint8Array): BaseEvent`: Takes raw Protobuf binary data and converts it back into a structured AG-UI event object. It also handles mapping Protobuf fields back to the event object structure. This is used by `parseProtoStream`.

*   **`typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/transform/sse.ts` (`parseSSEStream`)**:
    *   Takes an `Observable<HttpEvent>` (raw data chunks from an HTTP request).
    *   Uses `TextDecoder` to convert binary chunks (UTF-8 encoded text) into strings.
    *   Buffers these strings and splits them by `\n\n` (SSE message delimiter).
    *   For each SSE message, it extracts lines starting with `data:`, joins them if necessary, and then uses `JSON.parse()` to get the event object.
    *   Emits the parsed event objects as an `Observable`.

*   **`typescript-sdk/packages/client/src/transform/proto.ts` (`parseProtoStream`)**:
    *   Takes an `Observable<HttpEvent>` (raw data chunks).
    *   Buffers incoming `Uint8Array` data.
    *   Continuously tries to read a 4-byte length prefix (big-endian `uint32`) from the buffer.
    *   If the full message (length prefix + message body) is available in the buffer, it extracts the message bytes.
    *   Uses `proto.decode()` (from `@ag-ui/proto`) to deserialize these bytes into an AG-UI `BaseEvent`.
    *   Emits the parsed event object and removes the processed data from the buffer.

These components work together to ensure events can be reliably packaged, sent, received, and unpackaged.

## Conclusion: Bridging the Gap Between Agent and UI

You've now learned about **Event Encoding and Transport** in AG-UI. This is the critical mechanism that allows [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) to travel from the AI agent to your user interface.
*   **Encoding** is like choosing an envelope: human-readable JSON (often with SSE) or efficient Protocol Buffers. `EventEncoder` classes handle this.
*   **Transport** is the shipping method, typically HTTP, with Server-Sent Events being a common technique for streaming.
*   **Decoding** is opening the envelope: `parseSSEStream` and `parseProtoStream` on the client-side convert the raw network data back into usable event objects.

This system provides flexibility, allowing you to choose between readability for debugging and efficiency for production. Understanding how events are packaged and shipped helps you build more robust and performant AI applications.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the [Chapter 6: Dojo Demo Environment](06_dojo_demo_environment_.md), a place where you can see many of these concepts in action and experiment with AG-UI!

# Chapter 6: Dojo Demo Environment

Welcome to the final chapter of our AG-UI tutorial! In [Chapter 5: Event Encoding and Transport](05_event_encoding_and_transport_.md), we explored how AG-UI events are packaged and sent across the network. Now, it's time to see all these concepts come alive in a practical, interactive setting: the **Dojo Demo Environment**.

## What is the Dojo? Your Interactive AG-UI Playground

Imagine you've learned all about a new type of engine. You've studied its parts, how they communicate, and how fuel is delivered. Wouldn't it be great to visit an exhibition hall where you can see different vehicles using this engine, watch them run, and even peek under the hood?

That's exactly what the **Dojo Demo Environment** is for AG-UI!

The "Dojo" is an interactive web application designed specifically to showcase various AG-UI features and integrations. Think of it as an **exhibition hall** where each "booth" is a specific **demo**. Each demo highlights a particular capability of AG-UI, such as:
*   Building an AI chatbot that can use frontend tools (agentic chat).
*   Creating interactions where humans and AI collaborate on tasks (human-in-the-loop).
*   Implementing agents that can update shared information with the UI.

The Dojo helps you:
*   **See AG-UI in action**: Witness firsthand how different features work.
*   **Understand the code**: Explore the source code for each demo to see how it's implemented.
*   **Get inspiration**: Find examples and patterns you can use in your own AG-UI projects.

It's built using modern web technologies like Next.js (a React framework), making it a responsive and user-friendly web application.

## A Quick Tour of the Dojo

When you open the Dojo in your web browser, you'll typically see a layout like this:

```mermaid
graph TD
    DojoUI[Dojo Demo Environment UI] --> Sidebar[Sidebar (Left)]
    DojoUI --> MainContent[Main Content Area (Right)]

    Sidebar --> DemoList[Demo List (Select a Demo)]
    Sidebar --> ViewTabs[View Tabs (Preview, Code, Docs)]

    MainContent --> PreviewTab[Preview Tab (Interactive Demo)]
    MainContent --> CodeTab[Code Tab (View Source Code)]
    MainContent --> DocsTab[Docs Tab (Read Demo Information)]

    CodeTab --> FileTreeNav[File Tree Navigator]
    CodeTab --> FileTree[File List]
    CodeTab --> CodeEditor[Code Viewer]
```

Let's break down the main parts:

1.  **Sidebar (on the left)**: This is your control panel.
    *   **Demo List**: You'll find a list of available demos, like "Agentic Chat" or "Human in the Loop." Clicking on a demo loads it into the main content area. (This is handled by `DemoList` in `dojo/src/components/sidebar/sidebar.tsx`).
    *   **View Tabs**: Above or within the demo list area, you'll usually find tabs to switch between different views for the selected demo:
        *   👁️ **Preview**: See the demo live and interact with it.
        *   💻 **Code**: Look at the source code of the demo.
        *   📖 **Docs**: Read a description and explanation (often a README file) for the demo.

2.  **Main Content Area (on the right)**: This is where the action happens.
    *   **Preview Tab**: This is where the selected demo runs. You can chat with the agent, click buttons, and see AG-UI features working in real-time. For instance, in an agentic chat demo, you'd see the chat interface and the AI's responses.
    *   **Code Tab**: When you select this tab, the main area transforms into a code exploration view.
        *   **File Tree**: You'll see a list of files that make up the demo (e.g., `page.tsx` for the UI, `agent.py` for the agent logic). (Handled by `FileTree` in `dojo/src/components/file-tree/file-tree.tsx`).
        *   **Code Editor**: Clicking a file in the tree opens its content in a read-only code editor with syntax highlighting, so you can study how it works. (Handled by `CodeEditor` in `dojo/src/components/code-editor/code-editor.tsx`).
    *   **Docs Tab**: This view displays the `README.mdx` or `README.md` file associated with the demo, providing explanations, setup instructions, or highlights of what the demo showcases.

The overall structure and switching between these views are managed by components like `dojo/src/components/layout/main-layout.tsx` and `dojo/src/components/sidebar/sidebar.tsx`.

## What Makes a Demo Tick?

Each demo in the Dojo is a mini-application designed to showcase AG-UI. Here are the key ingredients:

### 1. Demo Configuration

Each demo is defined in a configuration file, typically `dojo/src/config.ts`. This file tells the Dojo what demos are available and where to find their information.

Here's a simplified example of how a demo might be configured:
```typescript
// Simplified from dojo/src/config.ts
function createDemoConfig({ id, name, description, tags }) {
  // ... (logic to find files for this demo, often from a generated files.json)
  return {
    id,          // Unique identifier, e.g., "agentic_chat"
    name,        // Display name, e.g., "Agentic Chat"
    description, // Short description
    path: `/feature/${id}`, // URL path to the demo
    tags,        // Keywords like "Chat", "Tools"
    files: [],   // List of source files (details gathered by a script)
  };
}

const config = [
  createDemoConfig({
    id: "agentic_chat",
    name: "Agentic Chat",
    description: "Chat with your Copilot and call frontend tools",
    tags: ["Chat", "Tools", "Streaming"],
  }),
  // ... other demos
];
```
This configuration helps the Dojo list the demos and load their respective pages and files.

### 2. The Demo Page (UI Implementation)

For each demo, there's a specific page component (e.g., `dojo/src/app/feature/agentic_chat/page.tsx`) that implements the user interface and integrates AG-UI client-side logic. This is where you'll see AG-UI components (often from libraries like `@copilotkit/react-core` and `@copilotkit/react-ui` which use AG-UI principles) in action.

For example, the "Agentic Chat" demo page might look like this:
```tsx
// Simplified from dojo/src/app/feature/agentic_chat/page.tsx
import React from "react";
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // Uses AG-UI
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";  // UI for chat

const AgenticChatDemoPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    // CopilotKit sets up the AG-UI environment
    <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="agenticChatAgent">
      {/* CopilotChat provides the chat interface */}
      <CopilotChat labels={{ initial: "Hi, I'm an agent. Want to chat?" }} />
    </CopilotKit>
  );
};

export default AgenticChatDemoPage;
```
This page uses `CopilotKit` to connect to an agent backend. The `CopilotChat` component handles displaying messages, which are exchanged using the [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) we learned about.

### 3. The Agent Logic

Each demo interacts with an AI agent. The agent's logic might be defined in:
*   A Python file (e.g., `agent.py`) if it's a Python-based agent running on a server.
*   A TypeScript file (e.g., `custom-agent.ts` as seen in [Chapter 2: Agent (Abstract Representation)](02_agent__abstract_representation__.md)) if it's a client-side or Node.js agent.
*   Sometimes, the agent logic is part of a backend API route (e.g., in `dojo/src/app/api/...`).

These agents are implementations that generate the [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md), process [Message and State Types](03_message_and_state_types_.md), and communicate using the [Event Encoding and Transport](05_event_encoding_and_transport_.md) mechanisms.

### 4. README Files

Each demo usually comes with a `README.mdx` (or `.md`) file. This file is displayed in the "Docs" tab and provides:
*   An overview of the demo.
*   What AG-UI features it highlights.
*   Sometimes, notes on how to understand its code.

## Behind the Scenes: Gathering Demo Content

To display the source code and READMEs in the Dojo's "Code" and "Docs" tabs, a build script is used. This script, often found at `dojo/scripts/generate-content-json.js`, runs before you start the Dojo.

**What the script does:**
1.  It looks at the demo configurations (like the one in `dojo/src/config.ts`).
2.  For each demo, it finds the specified source files (e.g., `agent.py`, `page.tsx`, `README.mdx`) from their locations in the project.
3.  It reads the content of these files.
4.  It bundles all this information (file names, paths, content, language for syntax highlighting) into a single JSON file, usually `src/files.json`.

```javascript
// Conceptual snippet from dojo/scripts/generate-content-json.js
// (Actual script is more complex)

// Configuration of files needed for each demo
const demoFileConfigs = {
  agentic_chat: ["agent.py", "page.tsx", "README.mdx"],
  // ... other demos
};

let allDemosContent = {};

for (const demoId in demoFileConfigs) {
  allDemosContent[demoId] = { files: [] };
  for (const fileName of demoFileConfigs[demoId]) {
    // const content = fs.readFileSync(path.join(demoDir, demoId, fileName), "utf8");
    // allDemosContent[demoId].files.push({ name: fileName, content: content, ... });
    // (Simplified: actual file reading and path logic is more detailed)
  }
}
// fs.writeFileSync("src/files.json", JSON.stringify(allDemosContent));
```
When you browse the "Code" or "Docs" tab in the Dojo, the UI reads from this pre-generated `files.json` to display the content. This makes loading the code and documentation very fast.

## Example: Exploring the "Agentic Chat" Demo

Let's say you want to understand how a basic agentic chat works with AG-UI:

1.  **Select the Demo**: In the Dojo's sidebar, click on "Agentic Chat."
2.  **Try it (Preview Tab)**:
    *   The main content area will load the chat interface.
    *   You can type messages and interact with the AI agent.
    *   Observe how the agent responds, perhaps using tools if the demo supports it. This interaction is powered by the [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) flowing between the UI and the agent.
3.  **Examine the Code (Code Tab)**:
    *   Switch to the "Code" tab.
    *   In the file tree, you might find files like:
        *   `page.tsx`: Click to see the React component for the chat UI. Notice how it uses `CopilotKit` and `CopilotChat`.
        *   `agent.py` or a similar file for agent logic (or an API route file): Click to see how the agent is defined, how it handles user messages, and how it emits events.
        *   `style.css`: See any custom styling for this demo.
4.  **Read the Docs (Docs Tab)**:
    *   Switch to the "Docs" tab.
    *   Read the `README.mdx` for the "Agentic Chat" demo. It will likely explain the purpose of the demo and highlight key aspects of its implementation.

By going through these steps, you can connect the theoretical AG-UI concepts (Events, Agents, Messages, State, Transport) to concrete, working examples.

## Conclusion: Your Launchpad for AG-UI Mastery

The Dojo Demo Environment is more than just a collection of examples; it's an interactive learning tool. It provides a hands-on way to:
*   **Reinforce your understanding** of AG-UI concepts covered in this tutorial.
*   **Discover practical implementations** of various features.
*   **Bootstrap your own projects** by adapting code from the demos.

We've covered a lot in this tutorial series, from the fundamental [AG-UI Events](01_ag_ui_events_.md) that enable communication, the [Agent (Abstract Representation)](02_agent__abstract_representation__.md) that powers the AI, the [Message and State Types](03_message_and_state_types_.md) that structure the data, the client-side [Event Stream Processing Pipeline](04_event_stream_processing_pipeline__client_side__.md) that brings it all together in the UI, and the [Event Encoding and Transport](05_event_encoding_and_transport_.md) methods that carry these events.

The Dojo is the perfect place to see all these pieces working in harmony. We encourage you to spend time exploring the different demos, peeking at their code, and experimenting. This hands-on experience will be invaluable as you start building your own amazing applications with AG-UI.

Happy coding, and we're excited to see what you build!

# Tutorial: ag-ui

AG-UI is a project that *standardizes* how **AI agents** communicate with **frontend applications**. It provides an open, lightweight, *event-based protocol*. This means AI agents send out a series of defined **AG-UI Events** (like "I'm starting to type" or "perform this tool call") to the app. The frontend then processes these events using a defined *pipeline* to enable real-time interactions such as agentic chat, frontend tool execution, and synchronization of shared *messages and state*. The project also includes a *Dojo demo environment* to showcase these capabilities.
